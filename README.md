# Fintech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

The company I chose to analyze for the case study was NorthOne (NO). Eytan Benassoun and Justin Adler, the two co-founders of NO, set out on a mission in 2017 to create a personal mobile banking experience catered to small businesses and startups. The two like-minded entrepreneurs noticed the lack of responsibility larger financial institutions take in servicing their smaller customers. They decided to focus on offering a banking expereince that empowers its consumer, making financial services more accessible and easier to understand. In 2018, NO was able to raise $2 million from private investors Peter Graham, Tom Graham and Ferst Capital Partners (PYMNTS.com. 2019). ahead of their official public release in August 2019. From then until present day, the company has raised upwards of $32 million in venture capital funding (Kirkwood, 2020). 


## Business Activities

NorthOne provides an application that eases the burden of financial upkeep on business owners. Their mobile banking app allows ease of access to financial information and duties related to the daily operations of a business as well as loans for small businesses. With that being said, NO’s intended consumers are small businesses, startups and freelancers. According to Oberlo.com, 31.7 million small businesses are operational in 2020 and this is following steady growth of 7.09% over a three year period (Gaubys, 2020). In comparison to other neobanks and mobile banking companies, NO uses APIs to enable a seamless transition of financial information over to its app. This allows NO to offer analytical and financial insight on the current standing of its consumer as well as the ability to deposit and send payments. By doing so, NO operates as a ‘challenger bank’ to its competitors involved in big banking as they eliminate the need for antiquated mobile banking tech that cannot integrate other information from other applications.

## Landscape

NorthOne belongs to the challenger bank/neobank sector of the financial industry. This domain represents companies who are able to leverage mobile banking removing the need for brick and mortar institutions and human interaction in setting up accounts, depositing funds, etc. Over the years, neobanks have gained traction and attention in the banking industry competing with institutions that have exited for decades. After the 2008 financial crisis, banks in the UK had suffered heavy losses allowing for a change in regulations for startup financial service companies to raise capital (Analysis, 2020). From there, the neobank industry was able to expand its presence worldwide and with it followed new regulations for these new entrants. Given the absence of physical branches, neobanks can  charge less fees to their users for transactions and focus their attention on the consumer experience. Starting with deposits and payments, neobanks have evolved into being able to offer loans to smaller entities who are being turned down by bigger banks. Many neobanks offer their users debit and credit cards as part of a membership allowing them access to receive rewards for spending. Now more than ever, neobanks are starting to offer exchange services in fiat and crypto markets, something several traditional banks are not offering in their mobile apps. More importantly, neobanks have been able to offer exceptional customer service and cater their services to specific business needs and niche consumers. This is expected to continue as sole proprietors and small businesses operating in a digital age require convenient and efficient banking solutions. Other competitors in its industry include Zafin, KOHO, Zag Bank, and Tangerine. These companies offer similar services to NorthOne with a debit card linked to your account, access to chequing and savings accounts, and access to loans.


## Results

NorthOne has seen remarkable growth numbers since its launch in August 2019 with 130% growth monthly (Azevedo, 2020). With the current events worldwide regarding access to funds, small business and entrepreneurs are looking for accessible loans and banking tech that suits their desire for convenience. This will further force smaller businesses to be drawn to services offered by neobanks such as NO and its ability to bridge other financial records/applications to itself. For companies in this domain, customer service and total users are two key metrics in how neobanks stack up against one another. The ability to be transparent with fees and prioritize customer satisfaction are two crucial elements separating neobanks from traditional physical branches. Among its competitors in the digital banking space, NorthOne is not one of the top players. Traditional banks such as BMO, Toronto Dominion, RBC, and Scotiabank have been able to create their own mobile banking apps making the transition for their longtime users much easier. With that being said, many new entrepreneurs and small businesses who are aware of their financial options in mobile banking will see the significant benefits neobanks serve in attempting to empower the economy’s smaller players.

## Recommendations

If I were to advise NorthOne on a new service to offer it would have to be crypto custody. With digital assets becoming a norm for investors to hold, digital banks will have to be able to offer some form of cryptocurrency related service, whether it be an exchange or a wallet. As an early entrant into this new market, NorthOne could be a popular choice for Canadian consumers looking for a banking institution that can host a crypto wallet. With companies such as WealthSimple offering a digital asset platform, Canadian investors will slowly start to migrate over to this new asset class looking for higher returns compared to the stock market. By diversifying itself from traditional banks who have online platforms (ie. BMO, TD, Scotiabank, etc), NorthOne would open up doors allowing its users to store their cryptos off exchanges. Given NO already uses APIs in conducting its services, this makes it easier for NO to creating partnerships with exchanges as well as allowing developers to build interfaces that could allow them to hold several different cryptos. This would be the most promising opportunity in separating itself from other neobanks in the industry.
